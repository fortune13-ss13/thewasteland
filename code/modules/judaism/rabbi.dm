	The Sages taught in a baraita: Rahab aroused impure thoughts by her name, i.e.,<br>
	the mere mention of her name would inspire lust for her; Yael, by her voice; Abigail, by remembering her;<br>
	Michal, the daughter of Saul, by her appearance. Similarly, Rabbi Yitzhak said: Anyone who says Rahab,<br>
	Rahab, immediately experiences a seminal emission due to the arousal of desire caused by Rahabâ€™s great beauty.<br>
	Rav Nahman said to him: I say: Rahab, Rahab, and it does not affect me. Rabbi Yitzchak said to Rav Nahman:<br>
	When I said this, I was specifically referring to one who knows her personally and recognizes her beauty.<br>
	Only for one who has met Rahab in person is the mere mention of her name capable of arousing lust.<br<br>
	The Gemara relates that Rabba and Rabbi Zeira prepared a Purim feast with each other,<br>
	and they became intoxicated to the point that Rabba arose and slaughtered Rabbi Zeira.<br>
	The next day, when he became sober and realized what he had done, Rabba asked God for mercy, and revived him.<br>
	The next year, Rabba said to Rabbi Zeira: Let the Master come and let us prepare the Purim feast with each other.<br>
	He said to him: Miracles do not happen each and every hour, and I do not want to undergo that experience again.<br></html>"}
